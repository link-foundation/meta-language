# Contributing to meta-language

This repository contains the Rust core for a self-describing meta language over
a links network. Contributions should keep the public API small, tested, and
aligned with the issue requirements.

[`docs/vision.md`](docs/vision.md) is the authoritative vision and architecture
specification. Read it before changing the grammar, parsing, semantics,
translation, dependency or acceptance code: a change that contradicts it must
update the vision in the same pull request rather than add a competing
description elsewhere. Requirements come from the sources registered in
[`parity/issue-195-sources.json`](parity/issue-195-sources.json) and are tracked
row by row in [`parity/issue-195-requirements.json`](parity/issue-195-requirements.json);
see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the rules that automated contributors follow.

## Development Setup

1. Install Rust with `rustup`.
2. Install the standard tooling:

   ```bash
   rustup component add rustfmt clippy
   cargo install rust-script
   ```

3. Install the repository's git hooks. The pre-commit hook cleans the
   regenerable caches of this worktree on every commit, including
   documentation-only commits, and still runs a hook that `pre-commit install`
   wrote (see [docs/cache-cleanup.md](docs/cache-cleanup.md)):

   ```bash
   node scripts/install-dev-hooks.mjs
   node scripts/install-dev-hooks.mjs --check
   ```

4. Build and test. Long builds and test runs can go through the cleanup
   wrapper, which bounds their parallelism and cleans up afterwards even when
   they fail or are interrupted:

   ```bash
   cd rust
   export CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2 RUST_TEST_THREADS=2 CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0
   node ../scripts/with-cache-cleanup.mjs --event test -- cargo check --all-targets --all-features
   node ../scripts/with-cache-cleanup.mjs --event test -- cargo test --test unit <filter>
   ```

   `node scripts/clean-caches.mjs` prunes the caches to the disk budget at any
   time, and `node scripts/clean-caches.mjs --full` removes all of them.

## Code Standards

- Model structural data as links and references to links.
- Keep external parser terminology at API boundaries and translate it into the
  links-network model internally.
- Prefer explicit metadata links or typed metadata over side tables.
- Add focused tests for each new behavior.
- Keep Rust tests under `tests/`; CI rejects `#[test]`, `#[cfg(test)]`, and
  `mod tests` markers under `src/`.
- Use Rust documentation comments for public APIs.
- Keep generated experiments in `experiments/` and real usage examples in
  `examples/`.

## Local Checks

Run the targeted checks for the change before pushing (see
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#local-checks-and-resources) for what not to run
locally); CI runs the full suites:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2 CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 cargo check --all-targets --all-features
RUST_TEST_THREADS=2 cargo test --test unit <filter>
RUST_TEST_THREADS=2 cargo test --test integration <filter>
(cd ../js && node --test tests/<area>*.test.js)
rust-script scripts/check-no-src-tests.rs
rust-script scripts/check-file-size.rs
rust-script scripts/check-crate-size.rs
```

The issue #195 delivery diagnostics can also inspect live merge enforcement
and reject stale delivered dependencies:

```bash
cd js
npm run check:issue-195:merge-enforcement
npm run check:dependencies:delivery
```

The dependency delivery check is separate from inventory integrity: a recorded
compatibility reason explains a stale pin but does not verify its upgrade.
The delivery check also needs the `package-lock.json` of a clean installed
candidate, supplied with `-- --consumer-lock /path/to/consumer/package-lock.json`.
It checks the dependency versions that the installed package resolves,
including nested copies; repository overrides alone do not establish delivery.
An item behind its current stable release passes only at its newest compatible
release, with the holders recorded by `npm run dependencies:refresh`. Each
holder must itself be delivered, and an external holder must be at its newest
release.
`-- --live` also refreshes the audit from the registries in memory, using `gh`
and `cargo`. It fails when the recorded audit is outdated or the registries
cannot be reached. Live mode is the default when `CI` or `ACCEPTANCE_CHECKPOINT`
is set, and `-- --offline` turns it off. The clean-consumer acceptance job runs
the live check against the lockfile of the installed npm artifact.

[`js/tests/issue-195-acceptance-gate-mutations.test.js`](js/tests/issue-195-acceptance-gate-mutations.test.js)
mutates the artifact behind each gate the vision lists under gate-mutation
tests and observes that gate fail, while the unmutated artifact passes it. A
change that weakens one of those gates fails that test. The proof obligation
and conformance oracle gates are
[`js/scripts/issue-195-proof-obligations.mjs`](js/scripts/issue-195-proof-obligations.mjs)
and [`js/scripts/issue-195-oracle-mapping.mjs`](js/scripts/issue-195-oracle-mapping.mjs).

## Changelog

User-facing changes need a fragment in `changelog.d/`:

```markdown
---
bump: minor
---

### Added
- Short description of the change.
```

Use `major` for incompatible API changes, `minor` for new backward-compatible
features, and `patch` for fixes.

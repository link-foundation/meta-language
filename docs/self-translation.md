# Self-translation

Self-translation ports meta-language's own modules between JavaScript,
TypeScript and Rust with meta-language itself. Both packages have the same
library API and the same CLI command, and their results are the same byte for
byte:

```js
import { selfTranslate } from 'meta-language';
const { code, items } = selfTranslate(source, 'JavaScript', 'Rust');
```

```rust
let translation = meta_language::self_translate(&source, "Rust", "JavaScript")?;
```

```sh
meta-language translate --to rust [--from js] [--items] module.mjs
```

A language is named by name or extension (`rust`, `rs`, `ts`, `mjs`); without
`--from`, the CLI takes it from the file extension. `--items` prints one line
per top-level item instead of the translation.

## The output

A translation starts with a header that records the source language and the
SHA-256 and length of the source:

```
// meta-language:self-translation:v1 source=JavaScript target=Rust sha256=… bytes=508
```

Each top-level item of the source then becomes one block:

- **translated**: the item went through links into the target language. Its
  source is kept above the code as `// |` lines, with the item's own hash:
  `// meta-language:translated JavaScript export_statement items=1 sha256=…`.
- **carried**: the translator cannot express the item in the target yet (it
  has no definition, or uses a construct the portable core does not cover).
  The item is kept as `// |` lines only, with the reason:
  `// meta-language:carried JavaScript import_statement (no definition)`.
  A carried item is a gap in the translator, reported in the item list and in
  the per-module report.
- **comment**: comment groups between items are copied as comments when the
  syntax fits both languages. A comment directly before an item travels with
  that item.

An isolated JavaScript declaration that fails type resolution is retried with
its contiguous declaration run in one checked scope when targeting Rust. A
successful run has one provenance block covering all of its source items;
forward calls and arrow-bound siblings use their actual checked declarations.
A failed run retains the original per-item decisions, so a carried sibling
never acquires a placeholder signature or implementation. Captures of mutable
or non-literal globals and bindings across intervening imports or statements remain separate
translation obligations.

The definitions the translated code needs (helpers and, for Rust, an
`#![allow(...)]` line) sit once between `// meta-language:prelude begin` and
`// meta-language:prelude end`.

## Round trips

Translating back reads the provenance:

- a translated or carried block whose code still matches its hash is restored
  to its source text exactly (status `restored`);
- an edited block drops its provenance and is translated again (status
  `translated`), so edits made in the target language carry over;
- when the header names the target language and the hash of the restored text
  equals the header's, the result is the original source byte for byte.

So JavaScript → Rust → JavaScript and Rust → JavaScript → Rust are lossless
for unedited output, and a translation into the same language returns the
source unchanged. Behavior across languages is checked by calling the
translated functions in both runtimes (see below).

## The shared corpus

`parity/self-translation/cases.lino` lists the cases and calls in Links
Notation, in the manner of
[relative-meta-logic PR #184](https://github.com/link-foundation/relative-meta-logic/pull/184):

```
(case arithmetic-to-rust (source sources/arithmetic.mjs) (from JavaScript) (to Rust) (expected expected/arithmetic-to-rust.rs))
(call arithmetic-to-rust (javascript add) (rust add) (arguments (f64 2) (f64 3.5)) (result 5.5))
```

Each case has its expected output and an `.items.lino` file with one
`(item start end term status "reason")` link per item. Both runtimes check
every case (`js/tests/self-translation.test.js`,
`rust/tests/unit/self_translation.rs`). The Rust test compiles the translated
Rust with clippy at `-D warnings` and runs each call; the JavaScript test
imports the JavaScript side and runs the same calls. Meta-language's own
modules round-trip byte for byte in both tests.

`npm run check:self-translation` checks that the expected files match the
translator; `node js/scripts/generate-self-translation-cases.mjs` rewrites
them after an intended change.

The Unicode-escape and default-parameter decisions in
`js/src/translation/frontend-rules.js` also run inside the Rust translator.
`node js/scripts/generate-frontend-rules.mjs` translates the complete module
through the portable core, applies the shared emitter decorators in
`parity/self-translation/frontend-rules-decorators.lino`, and formats the
result as `rust/src/translation/frontend_rules.rs`. The adapters supply UTF-16
code units and token records to these generated decisions. CI runs
`npm run check:frontend-rules` to reject stale generated code.

## Translated against hand-written Rust

`js/scripts/generate-self-translation-report.mjs` translates every module of
`js/src` into Rust and measures it against its hand-written counterpart
(`rust/src/<module>.rs` or `rust/src/<module>/mod.rs`): the items by status,
the Rust functions written, how many the hand-written Rust defines under the
same name and how many are identical up to whitespace, and how many translated
code lines the hand-written Rust holds too. The report also accounts for every
UTF-8 source byte using the item ranges and whitespace between them, and lists
translated, carried, comment and layout byte counts. It rejects overlapping,
out-of-bounds or split UTF-8 ranges. A module with code outside those ranges is
listed as refused, including when a parser fallback returned no items, so zero
carried items cannot conceal omitted source. Each module is measured twice: by
the generic translation and by the translation with the shared emitter
[decorators](decorators.md) of `parity/self-translation/decorators.lino`
(`--decorators` names another set), so the report shows how much of the
difference the decorators close. The whole of `js/src` takes over an hour on
one runner, so `--shard K/N` measures one of N shards that hold about the same
number of source bytes, and `--list` prints a shard's modules. CI's
`Self-Translation Report` jobs in `ci.yml` run eight shards beside the
JavaScript and Rust workflows. Each shard publishes its part of the report in
its job summary and as a `self-translation-report-<sha>-<shard>` artifact.
The JSON records the observed commit and the SHA-256 hashes of each module and
its Rust counterpart. Both acceptance suites download all eight shards and run
`--verify-reports <directory> --commit <sha>` before recording the per-module
report assertion. Verification rejects missing or duplicate modules, stale
sources, failed translations, inconsistent measurements and missing Markdown
rows without translating the whole corpus again.

Decorators edit emitted lines; they cannot add what the translator carries
untranslated (imports, classes, exports the emitters do not cover), so for
most modules the report shows the difference that is left honestly rather
than hiding it.

## Decorated translations

`selfTranslate(source, from, to, { decorators })` (JavaScript) and
`self_translate_decorated(source, from, to, &decorators)` (Rust) apply emitter
decorators to the code they write before the provenance marker is hashed, so
the decorated translation still translates back to its source. The corpus case
`arithmetic-decorated-to-rust` translates `sources/arithmetic.mjs` with
`decorators.lino` and is checked, function by function, against
`hand-written/arithmetic.rs`; removing the decorators gives the generic
translation again.

Sibling functions can also read immutable number, string and boolean literal
constants from their module. Local declarations and parameters take precedence
over those bindings, including a local declaration in its temporal dead zone.
This does not bind mutable values, array or object identities, or imported values.
Rust constant storage decisions and declaration rendering are generated from
the same JavaScript rules.

A declaration-only module with carried groups is also retried as one checked
scope, so JSDoc data types can bind across declarations. A failed retry keeps
its earlier decisions. Imports, executable statements and stored provenance
blocks are excluded. The frontend decision module itself is checked for zero
carried items, generated Rust execution and exact restoration in both runtimes.
Provenance records definitions, including attributes and documentation that
accompany a declaration. The provenance reader consumes attributes together
with the definition they annotate.

Bracketed JSDoc parameter names (`[value]` and `[value=99]`) now bind the
same declared type as an ordinary `value` parameter. Their default text is
documentation metadata: only the JavaScript function's actual default supplies
an omitted argument. The shared frontend decision is generated into Rust;
checks cover mismatched names, required arguments, execution and restoration.
This does not implement nullable values, tuple or record types, or Map types.

JavaScript `typeof` now translates for typed bindings and primitive literals,
with the JavaScript names `number`, `bigint`, `boolean`, `string` and `object`.
Both runtimes use generated decisions for eligible operands and type names.
Calls, field reads and other operand expressions remain refused: a type query
must not discard their evaluation, effects or exceptions. This is a bounded
extension of #212, not support for dynamic type unions or unbound names.

Homogeneous array `concat` calls lower to the existing checked array spread
representation. Checks cover argument order, one-level spreading for nested
arrays and a zero-argument copy. Scalar arguments and non-array receivers
retain diagnostics; this does not complete the remaining array operations.

A nonempty, childless parser `ERROR` root is retained as a carried syntax item
with its entire byte span. Parser budgets remain unchanged. Reverse translation
can restore an original source prefix when the header's byte length, language
and SHA-256 digest match and only formatting whitespace follows it. Appended
executable code prevents that restoration. Targeted checks cover the repository's
executor module and a source without a final newline. These changes preserve
source coverage; carrying a syntax error is not a semantic translation.

## Items that use other items

From JavaScript or TypeScript into Rust, a module is one scope. Each item is
translated after the items it names, and the signatures of the ones that
translated are bound for it: a function may call a function declared before or
after it (`const f = (x) => …` included) and read a top-level constant. The
Rust calls the function by the name its own translation gives it (`square(x)`,
`capped_square(x)`) and reads the constant by its name (`LIMIT`, `*COMPUTED`
for a `static`). A name whose item is carried, or that a cycle of items leaves
untranslated, stays unbound, so its callers are carried with the checker's
diagnostic. The corpus case `siblings-to-rust` runs such calls in both
runtimes. Both packages translate top-level constants into Rust.

A relative named import of another module of the crate,
`import { a, b as c } from './m.mjs'`, becomes `use crate::m::{a, b as c};`.
The module path comes from the specifier: `.mjs`, `.js` and the TypeScript
extensions are dropped, each segment is a Rust module name in snake case, and
`..` climbs from the module's directory, which the `moduleDirectory` option
(`module_directory` in Rust) gives as path segments; it is the crate root by
default, above which an import is refused. The imported names are bound when
the `imports` option maps the specifier to the signatures
`selfTranslationSignatures(source, language)` (`self_translation_signatures`
in Rust) gives for that module, its exported items that translate:

```js
const math = selfTranslationSignatures(mathSource, 'JavaScript');
selfTranslate(quadSource, 'JavaScript', 'Rust', { imports: { './math.mjs': math } });
```

```rust
let options = SelfTranslationOptions {
    imports: [("./math.mjs".to_owned(), signatures)].into(),
    ..SelfTranslationOptions::default()
};
self_translate_with(&quad_source, "JavaScript", "Rust", &options)?;
```

A bound function is named in snake case on both sides of `as`, as its own
translation names it. Without signatures the import still translates and the
items that use its names are carried. Default and namespace imports, Node.js
built-in modules and packages are refused with their own diagnostics; the
corpus case `imports-to-rust` lists them.

The dependency binder runs before the declaration-scope retry. Signatures from
successful retries are returned for the module's eligible exported functions;
imported aliases use the same signature lookup. Cross-module signatures still
exclude algebraic data types and guarded natural-number parameters. Nonliteral
constant captures stay unbound: lazy initialization does not establish eager
JavaScript initialization order or effects. The shared generated eligibility
rule is used by both binders.

Whole-string `startsWith`, `endsWith` and `includes` predicates use shared
generated decisions in both translators. Focused checks cover Unicode text,
empty searches, missing matches, four-target emission parity and Rust method
spellings (`starts_with`, `ends_with`, `contains`). Positional search arguments
and non-string operands remain explicit refusals. These checks do not establish
complete JavaScript string support or the full native execution matrix.

The Rust translator also handles Unicode lower/upper case mapping and
JavaScript `trim`, `trimStart` and `trimEnd`. Shared generated render decisions
retain U+0085 and trim U+FEFF. The shared binding examples check expanded case
mappings and both whitespace cases against JavaScript execution. Lean and Rocq
keep explicit refusals for these Unicode transformations.

Type queries also accept reads of eligible captured primitive literal constants.
The checked reference is identified from its external constant signature; source
calls and unsafe captures keep their existing refusals.

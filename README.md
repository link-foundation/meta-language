# meta-language

A Rust foundation for a universal, self-describing meta language backed by a
links network. The initial crate focuses on the common structural substrate:
links, references, source spans, parse status metadata, configurable trivia
attachment, self-description roots, and verification that a parsed region is
clean.

## What Is Implemented

- A mutable `LinkNetwork` where every item is a link.
- Self-referential point links, so a point is represented without introducing a
  separate primitive.
- Relation links as ordinary links with ordered references to other links.
- Field labels as explicit links instead of side-table metadata.
- Source metadata: link type, named/anonymous flag, byte range, row/column
  points, and `is_error`, `has_error`, `is_missing`, `is_extra` flags.
- `verify_full_match()` for reporting error and missing links in a selected
  source region.
- `parse()` as the default lossless parse entry point; the explicit
  `parse_lossless_text()` boundary remains available.
- `reconstruct_text()` for byte-for-byte reconstruction from non-missing token
  links ordered by source span.
- `insert_source_token()`, `insert_syntax_node()`, and `render_source()` for
  emitting target-language source from programmatically constructed syntax
  networks whose token leaves do not come from a prior parse.
- `projected_links()` for viewing the same lossless network as concrete syntax,
  abstract syntax, or semantic-only data by stripping lower-level preservation
  links from the view.
- `NetworkSnapshot` and `MutableNetworkSnapshot` for immutable versioned
  snapshots, editable forks, provenance, and forward commits.
- `AccessMode` for a read-only or mutable engine per user configuration:
  `freeze()` / `as_read_only()` yield a `ReadOnlyNetwork` view whose mutators
  are unreachable at compile time, and `parse_engine()` returns an
  `EngineNetwork` that rejects mutation with a clear diagnostic under
  `AccessMode::ReadOnly`; the frozen form reuses snapshot `Arc` sharing.
- `LinkStore` and `EngineLinkStore` for storage-backed create/read/update/delete
  and search operations: reads take `&self`, writes take `&mut self`, the
  default store is the in-memory `LinkNetwork`, and read-only access mode
  rejects writes through the same storage boundary.
- Optional `doublets` feature support for a file-mapped `DoubletsLinkStore`
  using `doublets-rs` 0.4, with lossless network round trips and a documented
  `doublets-web` backend label for browser/WASM exchange of the same binary
  graph layout.
- `ParseConfiguration` with containment-link, token-link, or combined trivia
  attachment policies.
- Mixed-region links for Markdown fenced code and HTML regions, plus HTML
  script, style, and style-attribute regions, with `txt` fallback for prose
  regions that content sniffing cannot classify.
- `LinkQuery` for structural matching by link type, term, language, named flag,
  tree-sitter-query-like S-expressions, captures, and host predicates.
- `find()` / `replace()` for codemod-style query transforms over captured links
  while preserving unchanged source bytes.
- `SubstitutionRule` / `apply_substitution()` for the link-cli-style
  match-and-substitute operation.
- `apply_edit()` for incremental source reparsing with stable outside-edit link
  ids, snapshot fork sharing for unchanged links, and structural diff sets for
  changed, added, and removed links.
- Concept-to-language syntax mappings for cross-language reconstruction.
- `reconstruct_text_as()` for semantic cross-language reconstruction and
  configurable formalization levels.
- Exact-match concept interning with language-bound expression links,
  queryable external-id aliases, LiNo concept-set import, and
  `seed_common_concept_ontology()` for the default 351-concept semantic
  lexicon plus structural programming-language concepts.
- Object-identity links, many-valued `TruthValue` semantics, and fixed-point
  `ProbabilisticTruthValue` confidence semantics.
- A testable parity registry and upstream-provenanced `PARITY_FIXTURES` for
  executable competitor and ecosystem feature gates.
- Structural LiNo parsing for links-notation doublets, triplets, named links,
  simple indented definitions, and self-references.
- `LANGUAGE_FIXTURES` with lossless parse/reconstruction samples for every
  required markup, programming-language, and natural-language target.
- `NATURAL_LANGUAGE_GRAMMAR_FIXTURES` with pass/fail grammaticality fixtures
  for the ten natural-language targets, including provenance for the
  repo-authored sentences and UD-derived tag vocabulary.
- Coverage targets for full `txt`, Markdown, HTML, and PDF support, mixed
  grammar embedding, ten programming-language parser targets, and ten
  natural-language parser targets.
- A documented text PDF profile (issue #84): `render_pdf_document()` /
  `parse_pdf_document()` map a language-free formatting document onto a valid,
  uncompressed single-page PDF (marked content for heading/paragraph/list, font
  resources for bold/italic), `parse("…", "pdf", …)` builds a byte-exact lossless
  network with additive concept-tagged structure links, and
  `reconstruct_text_as("PDF", …)` renders a structurally equivalent PDF through
  the shared concept layer. See `docs/pdf-fidelity.md` for the round-trip
  fidelity matrix.
- Self-description roots for `link`, `reference`, `relation link`, `language`,
  `grammar`, `type`, `Type`, `concept`, `point`, `field`, `trivia`, `region`,
  and `object`.
- A lossless text parser boundary that preserves tokens, trivia, recovery
  markers, and mixed-region metadata behind the same representation.

## Usage

```rust
use meta_language::{LinkNetwork, ParseConfiguration};

let network = LinkNetwork::parse("alpha beta", "plain-text", ParseConfiguration::default());
let report = network.verify_full_match(None);

assert!(report.is_clean());
assert_eq!(network.reconstruct_text(), "alpha beta");
```

The default parse path is lossless. Callers that need a narrower view can use a
projection without mutating the original network:

```rust
use meta_language::{LinkNetwork, NetworkProjection, ParseConfiguration};

let network = LinkNetwork::parse("alpha beta", "plain-text", ParseConfiguration::default());
let abstract_links = network
    .projected_links(NetworkProjection::AbstractSyntax)
    .count();

assert!(abstract_links < network.len());
```

Construct source directly as a syntax network when code should be generated
before validation:

```rust
use meta_language::{LinkNetwork, ParseConfiguration};

let mut network = LinkNetwork::new();
let tokens = [
    network.insert_source_token("JavaScript", "const answer = "),
    network.insert_source_token("JavaScript", "42"),
    network.insert_source_token("JavaScript", ";\n"),
];
let declaration = network.insert_syntax_node("JavaScript", "lexical_declaration", tokens);
network.insert_syntax_node("JavaScript", "program", [declaration]);

let source = network.render_source("JavaScript");
assert_eq!(source, "const answer = 42;\n");
assert!(LinkNetwork::parse(&source, "JavaScript", ParseConfiguration::default())
    .verify_full_match(None)
    .is_clean());
```

Configure the engine read-only when a parsed network must never be mutated. The
frozen view exposes every read operation but no mutators (calling one is a
compile error), and the `EngineNetwork` boundary rejects mutation at runtime:

```rust
use meta_language::{AccessMode, LinkNetwork, ParseConfiguration};

let configuration = ParseConfiguration::default().with_access_mode(AccessMode::ReadOnly);
let mut engine = LinkNetwork::parse_engine("alpha beta", "plain-text", configuration);

assert!(engine.is_read_only());
assert_eq!(engine.reconstruct_text(), "alpha beta");
assert!(engine.as_mutable().is_err()); // read-only engine rejects mutation
```

Use the storage trait directly when links need to move between in-memory and
binary stores. The optional doublets backend is enabled with
`--features doublets`:

```rust
use meta_language::{
    DoubletsLinkStore, LinkNetwork, LinkStore, LinkStoreQuery, ParseConfiguration,
};

let network = LinkNetwork::parse("const answer = 42;\n", "JavaScript", ParseConfiguration::default());
let mut store = DoubletsLinkStore::create_file("network.doublets").expect("create doublets store");
store.replace_with_network(&network).expect("write network");

let restored = DoubletsLinkStore::open_file("network.doublets")
    .expect("open doublets store")
    .to_network()
    .expect("read network");
assert_eq!(restored.to_lino(), network.to_lino());

let links = LinkStore::search(&restored, &LinkStoreQuery::new()).expect("search links");
assert_eq!(links.len(), restored.len());
```

`LinkStoreBackend::DoubletsWeb` names the WASM/browser exchange target for this
binary graph representation; native code uses `DoubletsLinkStore`, while a
browser host can map the same logical records through `doublets-web`.

Codemod-style transforms can select links with an S-expression query and replace
only captured source ranges:

```rust
use meta_language::{LinkNetwork, LinkQuery, ParseConfiguration, ReplacementRule};

let mut network = LinkNetwork::parse(
    "const oldName = call(oldName);\n",
    "JavaScript",
    ParseConfiguration::default(),
);
let query = LinkQuery::from_sexpression(
    r#"
    (identifier) @target
    (#eq? @target "oldName")
    "#,
)
.expect("query parses");
let captures = network.find(&query);

network.replace(
    &captures,
    &ReplacementRule::captured_text("target", "newName"),
);

assert_eq!(network.reconstruct_text(), "const newName = call(newName);\n");
```

Cross-language reconstruction can naturalize a parsed semantic proposition into
another target language, or expose progressively more formal representations:

```rust
use meta_language::{FormalizationLevel, LinkNetwork, ParseConfiguration};

let network = LinkNetwork::parse(
    "Hawaii is a state.\n",
    "English",
    ParseConfiguration::default(),
);

assert_eq!(
    network.reconstruct_text_as("Russian", ParseConfiguration::default()),
    "Гавайи это штат.\n"
);
assert_eq!(
    network.reconstruct_text_as(
        "Russian",
        ParseConfiguration::default().with_formalization_level(FormalizationLevel::Concept),
    ),
    "statehood(Q782, Q35657)\n"
);
```

## CLI

```bash
cargo run -- describe
cargo run -- verify --language plain-text --text "alpha beta"
```

`describe` prints the built-in self-description network as LiNo-style definition
lines that round-trip through `parse()` and `reconstruct_text()`. `verify` parses
the text with the lossless text boundary and exits successfully when the
resulting region has no error or missing links.

## Parity Implementation

The crate exposes `PARITY_TARGETS`, `MARKUP_LANGUAGE_TARGETS`,
`PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE_TARGETS`, `SECOND_TIER_PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE_TARGETS`,
`NATURAL_LANGUAGE_TARGETS`, `DATA_FORMAT_TARGETS`, and
`GRAMMAR_EMBEDDING_TARGETS` so comparison scope is part of the tested Rust API.
It also exposes `PARITY_FIXTURES`, with executable, provenance-tracked fixtures
covering every advertised target capability, and `LANGUAGE_FIXTURES`, with a
lossless fixture for every requested language target.
The current registry tracks tree-sitter, LibCST, Recast, jscodeshift, Rowan,
cstree, Roslyn, links-notation, link-cli, lino-objects-codec,
relative-meta-logic, formal-ai, and meta-expression.
Internal ecosystem fixtures now structurally parse links-notation doublet,
triplet, tuple, indented, and self-reference cases; link-cli create/update/delete/swap
substitutions; lino object round-trip, shared-reference, and circular-reference
cases; relative-meta-logic dependent, many-valued, probabilistic, and
liar-paradox cases;
formal-ai seed and benchmark `.lino` corpora; and meta-expression formalize and
naturalize examples backed by the verified 351-concept lexicon.

See [docs/parity-roadmap.md](docs/parity-roadmap.md) for the feature matrix,
executable fixture gates, and language coverage targets.
